    Left and Right channels for both sources and destinations appear to be configured separately by
    the GoXLR, but it's essentially handled with a list of 'on' or 'off' for channels in the
    correct order. The defined 'on' value is 8192 as a u16, which as bytes and endiand is
    [0x00, 0x20], so I'm just slapping the 0x20 into the correct byte slot of the list, and

    Notes:
    I recognise binary when I see it..

    The display is 128px across, and each byte represents a 1x8px vertical column.
    The display is 64px high, so 8 rows total.

    Data in each vertical column is a simple binary 'on / off' flag for each bit, with 0 being
    'dark', and 1 being 'light'. The bit order goes from Bottom -> Top

    So to colour the top and bottom pixel of the bar, the binary would be 01111110, in hex 0x7E

    The following code will draw a 2px border around the scribble area, leaving a one pixel 'safe
